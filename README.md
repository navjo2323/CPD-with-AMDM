# Alternating Mahalanobis Distance Minimization for Accurate and Well-Conditioned CP Decomposition


This repository contains the data and code used in " " (paper link). The code used to generate all the figures and Algorithm 5.1 is
[here](https://github.com/cyclops-community/tensor_decomposition/mahalanobis.py)

The parameters used for each figure are given below

```
```


The Code folder contains AMDM code for Algorithm 3.1 and ALS code used to generate data for Figure 3 in the paper.

The Data folder contains all the data used to generate all the other figures in the paper. Generating_plots.ipynb is a notebook that has code for producing each figure in the paper.
